# Make sure you have an export preset for web and you must
# have put `<script src="coi-serviceworker.js"></script>`
# in the "Head Include" property of the preset the
# "coi-serviceworker.js" script allow setting COOP and COEP
# headers in Github Pages, without, the game will not load

# 1. Ensure you have the action saved in the .github/workflows folder of your repo, unless you have Github pro it'll need to be public
# 2. Create the export web setting and ensure that your export_presents.cfg is pushed too.
# 3. The action should build your project and push it to the gh-pages branch.
# 4. Going into Settings > Pages > Deploy from a branch and select gh-pages, this should create a new job to deploy and should work then.

# I had an issue with imports in my project that required me to run the Godot build twice, which is line 71.
